# LinkedIn-Job-Results-Report
The objective of this code is to automate tedious parts of a job search by filtering out the noise

LinkedIn is a great place to find a job, but you often have to wade through an exorbitant amount of jobs that don't apply to you. LinkedIn is paid by companies to list new jobs, and LinkedIn shares these with as many candidates as possible to increase the metrics that they get paid for.

To save ourselves time, we can leverage the power of Python to create a report with jobs that directly pertain to us!

Things you'll need:

    Jupyter Notebook
    Chrome Browser
    Chrome Webdriver
    Selenium Package
    Pandas Package

There's some NLP I've done by scraping the job descriptions as well, but we'll save that for another time!
